#1000	Welcome
#1001	What we doing?
#1002	We are developing a program for the game Vietcong 1, which is quite old, dating back to 2003. We are creating an application called VcComHub that allows players to connect to a game server with any game mode from a single place. Our goal is to connect players and clans, bringing the community together to revive this game and ensure it doesn't fade into obscurity. By centralizing server access and fostering a vibrant player base, we aim to breathe new life into Vietcong 1 and keep its legacy alive.
